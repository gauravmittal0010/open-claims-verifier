# Contributing

This project is currently a design-first effort, not an implementation effort.

The primary goal is to test whether a constrained, non-authoritative AI system
for examining public claims is internally coherent.

We are not currently seeking feature development or product expansion.

The most valuable contributions at this stage are:

- identifying logical contradictions
- pointing out hidden assumptions
- stress-testing the limits of the model
- proposing failure scenarios

If you believe the core idea fails, please open an Issue and describe where and why.

Critical feedback is preferred over supportive feedback.
