# Open Claims Verifier (OCV)

## What this is
Open Claims Verifier is a public tool that helps people examine factual claims
using transparent sources, contradictions, and confidence indicators.

It does not tell users what to believe.
It shows what evidence exists, what conflicts, and what is missing.

## What this is NOT
- Not a government project
- Not a political platform
- Not a fact-policing authority
- Not an opinion engine

## Core principles
- Transparency over authority
- Evidence over opinion
- Humility over certainty
- Public auditability

If these principles are violated, the project should stop.

## Limitations
- The system can be wrong
- Data can be incomplete
- Sources may be biased

All sources and reasoning are visible so conclusions can be challenged.
